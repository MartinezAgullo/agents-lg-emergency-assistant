        Generate a comprehensive evacuation plan with TWO parts:

        ## PART 1: plan_schematic (Visual Action Plan)
        Create a concise, scannable schematic using this format:

        üö® PRIORITY 1 - IMMEDIATE (0-15 min)
        ‚îî‚îÄ [EVACUATE] asset_id ‚Üí evacuation_zone (X.X km, XX min)
           ‚îú‚îÄ Danger: danger_type at X.X km
           ‚îî‚îÄ Action: Brief specific action

        üî¥ PRIORITY 2 - URGENT (15-30 min)
        ‚îî‚îÄ [EVACUATE] asset_id ‚Üí evacuation_zone (X.X km, XX min)
           ‚îî‚îÄ Action: Brief specific action

        üü° PRIORITY 3 - HIGH (30-60 min)
        ‚îî‚îÄ [PROTECT] asset_id
           ‚îî‚îÄ Action: Brief specific action

        üöë HELPER DEPLOYMENT
        ‚îú‚îÄ helper_id: Specific role (e.g., "Secure perimeter at asset_x")
        ‚îî‚îÄ helper_id: Specific role

        ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES
        ‚Ä¢ Any time-sensitive constraints
        ‚Ä¢ Weather/danger movement considerations
        ‚Ä¢ Coordination requirements

        Requirements for schematic:
        - Use tree characters (‚îî‚îÄ, ‚îú‚îÄ) for visual hierarchy
        - Include distances and times for evacuations
        - Prioritize by urgency (immediate/urgent/high)
        - Assign specific roles to each helper
        - Keep each line under 80 characters
        - Use emojis for quick visual scanning

        ## PART 2: reasoning (Detailed Analysis)
        Provide comprehensive reasoning covering:

        1. **Threat Analysis:**
           - Primary dangers and their movement/evolution
           - Which assets are most vulnerable and why
           - Time-critical factors influencing decisions

        2. **Evacuation Strategy:**
           - Why specific evacuation zones were chosen for each asset
           - Route selection rationale (distance vs. safety vs. capacity)
           - Priority ordering justification

        3. **Helper Deployment Logic:**
           - Why each helper was chosen for their role
           - Coordination between multiple helpers
           - Backup plans if helpers are unavailable

        4. **Risk Mitigation:**
           - How the plan addresses high-risk scenarios
           - Contingencies for route blockages or zone capacity issues
           - Special considerations for sensitive assets

        5. **Timeline Justification:**
           - Why specific timeframes were assigned
           - Dependencies between evacuation steps
           - Critical path analysis

        ## General Requirements:
        1. **Prioritize Evacuation:** Identify all assets at High or Medium risk
           - Do NOT include EVACUATION_ZONE assets in evacuation list!

        2. **Assign Optimal Evacuation Zones:** Consider:
           - Distance and travel time (prefer closer for urgent)
           - Zone capacity and features
           - Danger proximity (NEVER assign to zones near dangers)
           - Route feasibility (prefer "feasible" over "challenging")
           - Multiple assets can share zones if appropriate

        3. **Identify Critical Assets:** Assess sensitive materials and determine protection needs

        4. **Strategic Helper Deployment:** Assign specific, actionable roles

        5. **Quality Score:** Self-assess effectiveness (0.0-1.0)

        Generate an evacuation plan with a schematic and detailed reasoning:

        3. **Prioritize Evacuation:** Identify all High/Medium risk assets (NOT evacuation zones!)
        4. **Assign helpers** with specific roles
